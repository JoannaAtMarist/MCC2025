<h2>ABOUT THE MCC</h2>

<p>
The inaugural Marist Computing Conference (MCC) continues a tradition of technical excellence which began with the establishment of the 
<a href="https://ecc.marist.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marist Enterprise Computing Community (ECC)</a> in 2008.  
The goal of creating a community for academic and industry collaboration led to the first Marist Enterprise Computing Community (ECC) Conference which was held in 2010 and continued annually for the next 14 years.  
With sponsorship initially provided through a CPATH grant from the National Science Foundation, this conference eventually attracted enough additional corporate sponsorship to continue once the original grant concluded.  
The community of partners has grown to over 3,000 academic industrial, governmental, and non-profit institutions worldwide.

With a new leadership team in the School of Computer Science and Mathematics and Marist becoming a University in 2025, the time had come to re-imagine this signature event.  
The Marist Computing Conference continues to explore excellence in enterprise computing but has expanded its scope to include topics such as Data Science, Mathematics, Quantum Computing, Cybersecurity, Information Technology/Systems, and more.  
This yearâ€™s conference is generously sponsored by the <a href="https://ecc.marist.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enterprise Computing Community</a> and the Richard Foy Endowment, making it possible to once again bring this event to campus at no cost to attendees.  
This year, we have also partnered with the student research poster competition 
<a href="https://bit.ly/mhvtm-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mid-Hudson Valley TechMeet</a>, as well as several other strategic partners including 
<a href="https://www.sentricus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentricus</a>, 
<a href="https://www.neweratech.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Era Technologies</a>, and the Mid-Hudson sections of 
<a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE</a> and 
<a href="https://www.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM</a>.  
Our goals of technical community building and academic/industry partnership remain unchanged, and we look forward to welcoming returning and new participants to campus for the 2025 Marist Computing Conference.
